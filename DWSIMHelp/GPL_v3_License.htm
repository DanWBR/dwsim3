2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;</FONT><A href="http://fsf.org/"><FONT

 <EM><FONT

Preamble</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The GNU General 
Public License is a free, copyleft license for<BR>software and other kinds of 
works.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The licenses 
for most software and other practical works are designed<BR>to take away your 
freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp; By contrast,<BR>the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all 
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its 
users.&nbsp; We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public 
License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released 
this way by its authors.&nbsp; You can apply it to<BR>your programs, 
too.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; When we speak 
of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.&nbsp; Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that 
you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can 
do these things.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To protect your 
rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you 
to surrender the rights.&nbsp; Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities 
if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; For example, if 
you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you 
must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.&nbsp; You 
must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.&nbsp; And 
you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Developers that 
use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on 
the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to 
copy, distribute and/or modify it.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; For the 
developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is 
no warranty for this free software.&nbsp; For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, 
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their 
problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous 
versions.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Some devices 
are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the 
software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.&nbsp; This is 
fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to 
change the software.&nbsp; The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the 
area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most 
unacceptable.&nbsp; Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to 
prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.&nbsp; If such problems arise 
substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to 
those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom 
of users.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Finally, every 
program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow 
patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose 
computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that 
patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively 
proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be 
used to render the program non-free.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The precise 
terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification 
follow.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT 
face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 0. 
Definitions.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "This License" 
refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "Copyright" 
also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as 
semiconductor masks.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "The Program" 
refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.&nbsp; Each 
licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp; "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be 
individuals or organizations.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "modify" a 
work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion 
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.&nbsp; 
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a 
work "based on" the earlier work.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "covered 
work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the 
Program.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "propagate" 
a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you 
directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright 
law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp; 
Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), 
making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as 
well.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To "convey" a 
work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or 
receive copies.&nbsp; Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer 
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; An interactive 
user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it 
includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an 
appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no 
warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), 
that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy 
of this License.&nbsp; If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or 
options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this 
criterion.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 1. Source 
Code.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The "source 
code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making 
modifications to it.&nbsp; "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a 
work.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "Standard 
Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by 
a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a 
particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers 
working in that language.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The "System 
Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a 
whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major 
Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only 
to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a 
Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in 
source code form.&nbsp; A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major 
essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific 
operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler 
used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run 
it.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source 
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object 
code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those 
activities.&nbsp; However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, 
or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used 
unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the 
work.&nbsp; For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition 
files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for 
shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is 
specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or 
control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the 
work.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The 
Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same 
work.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 2. Basic 
Permissions.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; All rights 
granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the 
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.&nbsp; 
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the 
unmodified Program.&nbsp; The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered 
by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered 
work.&nbsp; This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other 
equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may make, 
run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so 
long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.&nbsp; You may convey covered 
works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications 
exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, 
provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all 
material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.&nbsp; Those thus making or 
running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, 
under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any 
copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with 
you.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Conveying under 
any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated 
below.&nbsp; Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it 
unnecessary.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 3. Protecting 
Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; No covered work 
shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright 
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or 
restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; When you convey 
a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by 
exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and 
you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as 
a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal 
rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 4. Conveying 
Verbatim Copies.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any 
medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that 
this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 
apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; 
and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the 
Program.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may charge 
any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 5. Conveying 
Modified Source Versions.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the 
Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions:</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you 
modified<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
released under this License and any conditions added under 
section<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; This requirement modifies the requirement 
in section 4 to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp; 
This<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the 
work, and all its parts,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are 
packaged.&nbsp; This License gives no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to 
license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) 
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must 
display<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program 
has interactive<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Appropriate 
Legal Notices, your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work need not make them do 
so.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A compilation 
of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by 
their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with 
it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its 
resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the 
compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp; Inclusion 
of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the 
other<BR>parts of the aggregate.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 6. Conveying 
Non-Source Forms.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may convey 
a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under 
the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical 
product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), 
accompanied by the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source fixed on a durable 
physical medium<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software 
interchange.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical 
product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including a physical distribution medium), 
accompanied by a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three 
years and valid for as<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare parts or 
customer support for that product<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model, to give anyone 
who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the 
Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product 
that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price 
no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable cost of physically performing 
this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of source, or (2) access to copy 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source from a network server at no 
charge.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding 
Source.&nbsp; This<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only 
occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received 
the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with 
subsection 6b.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) 
Convey the object code by offering access from a 
designated<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place (gratis or for a charge), and offer 
equivalent access to the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source in the same 
way through the same place at no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further charge.&nbsp; You 
need not require recipients to copy the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding 
Source along with the object code.&nbsp; If the place to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding 
Source<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a different server (operated by you or a 
third party)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, 
provided you maintain<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the object 
code saying where to find the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.&nbsp; 
Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source, 
you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as 
long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) 
Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, 
provided<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the object code and 
Corresponding<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source of the work are being offered to the 
general public at no<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under subsection 
6d.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A separable 
portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying 
the object code work.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "User 
Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible 
personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household 
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a 
dwelling.&nbsp; In determining whether a product is a consumer 
product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp; For a 
particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to 
a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the 
status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular 
user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp; A 
product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has 
substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses 
represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "Installation 
Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization 
keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions 
of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its 
Corresponding Source.&nbsp; The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the 
continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or 
interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If you convey 
an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use 
in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in 
which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to 
the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the 
transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this 
section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.&nbsp; But this 
requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the 
ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the 
work has<BR>been installed in ROM).</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The requirement 
to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to 
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has 
been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which 
it has been modified or installed.&nbsp; Access to a<BR>network may be denied 
when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation 
of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across 
the network.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Corresponding 
Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this

 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 7. Additional 
Terms.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; "Additional 
permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making 
exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that 
are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were 
included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable 
law.&nbsp; If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that 
part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program 
remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional 
permissions.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; When you convey 
a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.&nbsp; (Additional 
permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when 
you modify the work.)&nbsp; You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, 
added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate 
copyright permission.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, 
you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement 
the terms of this License with terms:</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from 
the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; 
or</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 
Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices 
or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the 
Appropriate Legal<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by works containing 
it; or</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 
Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, 
or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that modified versions of such material be 
marked in<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as different from the original 
version; or</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) 
Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors 
or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) 
Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of 
some<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trade names, trademarks, or service marks; 
or</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) 
Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions 
of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the 
recipient, for<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual 
assumptions directly impose on<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and 
authors.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; All other 
non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within 
the meaning of section 10.&nbsp; If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any 
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License 
along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that 
term.&nbsp; If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits 
relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work 
material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the 
further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or 
conveying.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If you add 
terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the 
relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to 
those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable 
terms.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Additional 
terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a 
separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements 
apply either way.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 8. 
Termination.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may not 
propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this 
License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any 
patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 
11).</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; However, if you 
cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular 
copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the 
copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) 
permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by 
some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Moreover, your 
license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the 
copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this 
is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for 
any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 
days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Termination of 
your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who 
have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.&nbsp; If your 
rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not 
qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 
10.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 9. Acceptance 
Not Required for Having Copies.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You are not 
required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the 
Program.&nbsp; Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a 
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise 
does not require acceptance.&nbsp; However,<BR>nothing other than this License 
grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.&nbsp; These 
actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.&nbsp; 
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your 
acceptance of this License to do so.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 10. Automatic 
Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Each time you 
convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from 
the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to 
this License.&nbsp; You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third 
parties with this License.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; An "entity 
transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging 
organizations.&nbsp; If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity 
transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work 
also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in 
interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to 
possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in 
interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable 
efforts.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; You may not 
impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or 
affirmed under this License.&nbsp; For example, you may<BR>not impose a license 
fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this 
License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by 
making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any 
portion of it.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 11. 
Patents.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A "contributor" 
is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or 
a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp; The<BR>work thus licensed is called 
the contributor's "contributor version".</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A contributor's 
"essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the 
contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be 
infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or 
selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be 
infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor 
version.&nbsp; For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right 
to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements 
of<BR>this License.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Each 
contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent 
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, 
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents 
of its contributor version.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; In the 
following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent 
infringement).&nbsp; To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to 
make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the 
party.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If you convey a 
covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding 
Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and 
under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server 
or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the 
Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself 
of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) 
arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to 
extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.&nbsp; "Knowingly relying" 
means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your 
conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the 
covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in 
that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If, pursuant to 
or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or 
propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent 
license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to 
use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then 
the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of 
the covered<BR>work and works based on it.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; A patent 
license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its 
coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of 
one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this 
License.&nbsp; You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an 
arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing 
software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent 
of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party 
grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a 
discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered 
work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) 
primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations 
that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that 
arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 
2007.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Nothing in this 
License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or 
other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under 
applicable patent law.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 12. No 
Surrender of Others' Freedom.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as 
to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at 
all.&nbsp; For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a 
royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the 
only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to 
refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 13. Use with 
the GNU Affero General Public License.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine 
any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero 
General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the 
resulting work.&nbsp; The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the 
part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU 
Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a 
network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 14. Revised 
Versions of this License.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; The Free 
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU 
General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<BR>be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address 
new problems or concerns.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Each version is 
given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the<BR>Program specifies that a 
certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later 
version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published 
by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a 
version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version 
ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If the Program 
specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General 
Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a 
version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the 
Program.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; Later license 
versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.&nbsp; However, no 
additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a 
result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer 
of Warranty.</FONT>             </EM></P>

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</FONT>             </EM></P>
<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; If you develop 
a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the

<P align=left> 
 <EM><FONT face=Courier>&nbsp; To do so, 
attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<BR>to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found.</FONT>             </EM></P>
